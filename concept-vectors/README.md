## Concept Vector Extraction

For the entire experiment, concept vectors are extracted using the following protocol:

1. Use the prompt `Tell me about {word}`.
2. Collect the model's activations on the token immediately prior to the assistant's response, specifically the `:` token that indicates the beginning of the assistant turn. This setup will change depending on the model's chat template.

**Note:** Although concept words appear capitalized in the lists below (and in the paper), they are lowercased in this prompt.

## Concept Words

These are the words used to derive concept vectors for injection. There are 50, matching the 50 sentence/word pairs.

```
Dust, Satellites, Trumpets, Origami, Illusions, Cameras, Lightning, Constellations, Treasures, Phones, Trees, Avalanches, Mirrors, Fountains, Quarries, Sadness, Xylophones, Secrecy, Oceans, Information, Deserts, Kaleidoscopes, Sugar, Vegetables, Poetry, Aquariums, Bags, Peace, Caverns, Memories, Frosts, Volcanoes, Boulders, Harmonies, Masquerades, Rubber, Plastic, Blood, Amphitheaters, Contraptions, Youths, Dynasties, Snow, Dirigibles, Algorithms, Denim, Monoliths, Milk, Bread, Silver
```

## Baseline Words

These are used for the random injection condition. Note that "Butterflies" appears twice (indices 68 and 86); this is likely inconsequential.
